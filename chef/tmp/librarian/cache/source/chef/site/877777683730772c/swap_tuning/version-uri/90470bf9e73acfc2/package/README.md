Chef cookbook to create a swap file of the recommended size considering the system memory.

This can be considered a general purpose cookbook but certainly not recommended for all cases.

Swap size is chosen based on the following documentation:

* [RedHat 7 Recommended Partitioning Scheme](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/sect-disk-partitioning-setup-x86.html#sect-recommended-partitioning-scheme-x86)

| RAM Size     | Recommended Swap     |
|--------------|----------------------|
| &le; 2 GB    | 2 &times; RAM        |
| 2 GB - 8 GB  | = RAM                |
| 8 GB - 64 GB | &frac12; &times; RAM |
| &gt; 64 GB   | workload dependent   |

* [Ubuntu SwapFaq - How much swap do I need?](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#How_much_swap_do_I_need.3F)

In case you already have swap in the system, creates another swap file with the difference if necessary.
